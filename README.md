  ## 1. Motivation:-
  This project is intended to developed core understanding of Python, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib etc. And is a integral part of DS_GA 1007 course in     Center of Data Science at **New York University**.
  
  In the new mercurial world, the need to remain upto date regarding the trending technologies is utmost necessary. Desired Tools, platform, codingLangaue   are changing the course of traditional method of learning and technologies.
  
  ## 2. Data Notebook Sections:-
  * Perform Initial EDA on the StackOverflow Survey Data.
  * Data Preprocessing, finding missing values and analyzing the dataset.
  * Plot Null values to analyze the percentage of missing data for each columns.
    * Cleaning the data and encoding some columns
      * Here we will be working on a subset of columns in the original dataset.
      * Printing the head of the new subset dataframe
    * Encode the 'Gender' column in the dataset and plot the encoded data
    * Plotting Unique Categorical data on Mental health Column
   * Analyzing the dataset based on the country information.
   * Exploratory Data Analysis based on Country.
   * Correlation between Variables.
   * Salary Analysis across Experience and Gender.
   * Top Trending Technologies which included Programming languages, Database, WebFrame work, Platform, Miscellaneous Tech and Tools in 2021.
      * Most Trending coding language available in 2021
